Sample Data
===========

*500.csv*
Took a list of [500 names][0] to allow me to try to do more complex jobs on map/reduce.

The list is a CSV files containing the following data:

`First Name`;`LastName`;`Company`;`Address`;`City`;`County`;`State`;`ZIP`;`Phone`;`Fax`;`Email`;`Web`

> Note: to make it easier to parse I took off all `"` from the original file and changed the `,` for `;`
